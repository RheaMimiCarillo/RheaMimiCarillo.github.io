# Portfolio Prep

## Tell me about yourself

*Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:*

**1. A 2 or 3 word catchy title. Avoid cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.**

**2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?**

**3. Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.**

**4. What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.**

## Gather your assets
