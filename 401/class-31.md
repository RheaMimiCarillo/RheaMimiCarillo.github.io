# Context API

## [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html){:target="_blank"}

**1. What can React Context provide your app?**

React Context will allow my app to pass data down to children components without having to manually pass down props.

**2. Why might we use Context?**

We might use Context for declaring global variables.

**3. Why should we use it sparingly?**

We want to use it sparingly, because it makes reusing components difficult.

## [Awesome React Context links](https://github.com/diegohaz/awesome-react-context){:target="_blank"}

**1. Consume content from (at least) two of the Awesome React Context links.  Share your take-away from each:**

  1. Takeaway 1: `Constate` has me looking at things differently. In their example code in `API`, they have multiple little functions that seemingly all carry separate logic, but then tie into their `<App />` component. What was puzzling to me was that they created `state` in its own function, without nesting it into `App`, as we've done in class. I think I need to re-imagine how I develop and structure my apps.

  2. Takeaway 2: The `themer` example on CodeSandbox has a syntax error and won't load, properly. I wanted to use this as a reference, but I shouldn't go around fixing reference material. That beings said, I like the idea of having a global toggle for `day` and `night` modes.

## Additional Questions

**1. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-7), What do you look forward to learning?**

I'm looking forward to `Cookies`. I've heard the term a lot and see the popup every time I go to a new website, but what is it really?

**2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/)?**

My learning goal is to develop solid fundamental programming principles, so I can translate my skills over to all sorts of programming languages and programs.

## Things I Want To Know More About

- I would like to know more about how we can easily make buttons to toggle a light and dark mode, without having to use inline styles.
