*Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive*

I don't get the *pretend your life is worth $1,000/hr* thing. If my time was worth a thousand an hour, no matter what I'm doing, then I wouldn't spend my precious few hours laboring. I'd be spending my time on activities and with people who bring me joy! Forget work! Forget slaving away! I'd be indulging in creative pursuits and traveling the world when not enjoying the presence of my loved ones. Who wants to spend their $24,000 each day in the gulag, sustaining the American oligarchy in exchange for the crumbs that fall through the cracks. I'm willing to best most humans wouldn't rather spend their to spend their time laboring over being with family or in peaceful solitude, right?

## Discussion Questions

**1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

The only thing that I can ***truly*** bring to a potential employer that nobody else can is my personal experience and perspective. I can bring my unique combination of skills and strategies with me. Corporations have demonstrated, time after time, that everyone is replaceable, so I'm not going the sweat over this.

**2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

- When I feel stuck, I'll take breaks (snack, walk, sleep, shower), ask someone else for their unique perspective, and when all else fails, I'll use my imagination to gamify my tasks to help remind me that there needn't be fear of failure.

## Things I want to know more about

- What are some universal and foolproof ways to gamify tasks?
