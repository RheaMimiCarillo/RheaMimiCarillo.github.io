- the thing with my name and stuff is called a 'prompt'
- command line and terminal are interchangeable terms
- a command is typically entered first
- an arugment starting with a dash (-) is called an 'option'
- what we see in the terminal is called the 'shell'

- when I type in `echo` into my shell, I just see an empty line...?
