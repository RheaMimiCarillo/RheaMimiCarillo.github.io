## Discussion Questions

**1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

One important thing to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to a problem is time and space complexity required to solve the problem

**2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

We can avoid an infinite recursive call by specifying two cases:

1. a base case, where the function doesn't call itself
2. a recursive case where the function calls itself
