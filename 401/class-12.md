# Socket.io

## [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

**1. What is a Web Socket?**

It is a communication protocol where client and server can send data in either direction

**2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.**

- The client sends a handshake request with HTTP
- The server returns a `WebSocket handshake response`

Once the hands have been shook, a `bidirectional` communication lane opens where data transfer doesn't have to conform to HTTP.


**3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.**

request from that client

## [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

**1. What does the event handler `io.on()` do?**

It listens for certain events in the event pool, then calls a callback function.

**2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected.**



**3. What does socket.emit() do?**

Socket.emit() is method to publish data into the event pool

## [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

**1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).**

WebSocket is a protocol for data transfer. Socket.IO is a platform for which we can actionably use the WebSocket protocol.

**2. When would you use Socket.IO?**

When you'd like an easy way to implement the WebSocket protocol into your app.

**3. When would you use WebSockets?**

When you want real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server.
