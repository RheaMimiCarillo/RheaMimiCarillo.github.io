# Context API - Behaviors

## [Hooks and Context example](https://medium.com/swlh/snackbars-in-react-an-exercise-in-hooks-and-context-299b43fd2a2b){:target="_blank"}

**1. With regard to the React Context API, what does a "provider" do?**

The provider exists to provide context to child components, no matter how deeply they are nested.

**2. With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a "consumer" role?**

A consumer would be wrapped inside of a provider component to access the data from the provider.

**3. Specifically with Context, how are we "wrapping" components to achieve our goals?**

Again, we can nest children components within the provider.

## [Awesome React Context links](https://github.com/diegohaz/awesome-react-context){:target="_blank"}

**1. Consume content from (at least) two more of the Awesome React Context links.  After some familiarity with React Context, once again share your takeaways from each:**

  1. Takeaway 1: Looking at the ThemeContext link, I now notice that these examples and articles mention abstracting away managing the state of the context from the consumer.
  2. Takeaway 2: I'm looking at a lot of these packages that seem to be centered around simplifying the use of react context. While it's tempting to try to implement, I feel like I'd be robbing myself of valuable experience and context by skipping out on learning the native implementation, first.

## Additional Questions

**1. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-7), What do you look forward to learning?**

I'm still looking forward to cookies. What are they? How are they useful? How can they be harmful?

**2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/)?**

My learning goal for this lecture is to better understand the syntax and implementation of react context.

## Things I Want To Know More About

- I would like to know if my hashtable class is set up properly. I got it to work on Sunday night, but I feel like I kind of hacked my way into making it work with the provided LinkedList and Node classes.
