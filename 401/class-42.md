## Ethics in the workplace

Right off the bat, I already hold a negative bias towards multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporations. I'm also battling a feeling that I can't quite describe in one word. On one hand, Microsoft isn't a dedicated military-industrial complex name, like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, and don't the same sting as those companies do. Microsoft is a household name whose products are quite familiar to everyday life, so to hear they took a $749 million contract to develop an augmented reality system which would enable the game-ification of warfare? This contract was cancelled due to public demand and how on-the-nose it's implications were to the killing game, but what of the other $10s of billions in contracts Microsoft has won from the US government? I say nay to the military-industrial complex, especially the lobbyists and the revolving-door politicians.

## Ehics in technology

[Will democracy survive big data and AI?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)

My thoughts before reading the article are:
  1. AI is teaching itself, now, so how can we precisely gauge it's bias when helping make decisions across all aspects of life? 
  2. How do we evaluate the biases of the programmers who work on the deep learning algorithm these AI depend on and then measure it's effects on how the AI functions?
  3. Machines can do so much more than humans can in the same time. If and AI can pump out and spread a month's work of content in 5 minutes, how would possibly handle mis-information, dis-information, promotion of racism or hate speech, anti-human rights rhetoric, social engineering, etc. (especially if there's a financial interest involved)?
