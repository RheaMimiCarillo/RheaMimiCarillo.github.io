## [Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

**1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**

EventEmitter

**2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

The combination promotes the single-responsibility principle

**3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

Event Driven Programming might be useful for testing backend functionality, since many backend features are abstract in nature and don't provide as much, if any visual feedback, compared to frontend web apps.
