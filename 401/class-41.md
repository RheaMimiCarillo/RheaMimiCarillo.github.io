# React Native

## [getting started with react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started){:target="_blank"}

**1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.**

1. `<View>` - A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls

2. `<Text>` - Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events

3. `<Image>` - Displays different types of images

**2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?**

React Native allows React developers to create mobile apps using JavaScript, as opposed to Java, Kotlin, Swift, or Objective-C.

**3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app?  How does that compare to a React app?**

The **view** is the building block of React Native apps. They sort of seem like interactive <Card-like> components that can have content nested inside of them.

## [expo](https://expo.io/){:target="_blank"}

**1. What solution does expo provide?**

`Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.`

**2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____________ workflow.**

...which is why we call it the `managed` workflow;

**3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?**

Writing code in Expo is writing React Native code. A difference is that Expo allows devs to open project on their phone whilst working on them, without th need for XCode or Android Studio.

## [expo snack](https://snack.expo.io/){:target="_blank"}

**1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?**

This tool allows devs to write code for mobile apps and test the code on a phone by going to the development page's URL.

## [ejecting](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject){:target="_blank"}

**1. What does "eject" mean within the context of Expo?**

To "eject" is to port an Expo project into code that can be run in Xcode and Android Studio.

**2. When should you not eject?**

1. You only want to deploy your app to the app stores
2. You're unfamiliar with the Expo environment

**3. Why might you choose to eject?**

You require a `Native` module that Expo doesn't support.

## Additional Questions

**1. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-7), What do you look forward to learning?**

I'm looking forward to gain familiarity with developing for the mobile environment and gaining insight on the associated special conditions associated with mobile needs and conventions.

**2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/)?**

My learning goal is to learn the tradeoff between developing with Expo, as opposed to developing in a more Native language.
