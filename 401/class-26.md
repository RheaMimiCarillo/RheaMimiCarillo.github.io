# Component Based UI

## [react hello world](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html){:target="_blank"}

**1. What are the building blocks of a React app?**

Components and elements.

**2. What is the difference between an element and a React component?**

A React element is closer to plain-ol-HTML whilst a React component returns React Elements.

**3. What are some advantages of React's component based architecture?**

The main advantage of React's components are that they can be dynamic and respond to changes in state or user input.

## [introducing JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html){:target="_blank"}

**1. What is JSX and why do we use it?**

JSX is an extension we use to run JavaScript code by nesting the code in curly braces: {};

**2. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.**

We can write an html element and embed a JavaScript function into the content to render whatever is in the function by surrounding it with curlies.

**3. Is it safe to embed user input in JSX?  Explain.**

It is safe to embed user input. React DOM escapes and values embedded into JSX before rendering them, so threat actors may not inject any malicious code.

## [rendering elements](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html){:target="_blank"}

**1. Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.**

Each React Component can be thought of as an ingredient in a sandwich. Each bit can be split and reused in other sandwich combinations.

**2. Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?**

Mutability is the ability to change something. React elements are immutable, but React Components can be updated dynamically with changes in state or user input.

**3. If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?**

If changes are made to the UI React and we're using a component, that component will be updated/re-rendered.

## Additional Questions

**1. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**

I'm looking forward to learning React Native, because I would like to develop a mobile version of the 201 final project my group worked on (guess-the-rainbow).

**2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**

My goal is to be able to know when it's appropriate to use class and functional-based React Components, as well as how to wisely implement each.

## Things I Want To Know More About

- I would like to know how old labs and project we made with React Classes would be more appropriate with React Functions.
