# Chart.js, Canvas


## [JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)


1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?

It allows a developer to create a 'canvas' to draw on using JavaScript.

2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>`tag?

Anything inside the beginning and closing canvas tags are 'fallback content' that will only display to the user if the browser doesn't suppport the `<canvas>` element.

3. Explain what the `getContext()` method does.

The `getContext()` method grabs the metaphorical 'paintbrush and palette' for drawing on a 2D plane on the canvas element.

## [Chart.js Documentation](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/)

Charts have the advantage of being easier to read and can display data visually in ways that are impossible in a table.

2. How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?

On the Salmon Cookies lab, I could've made bar charts to visually display sales across every branch, which would've provided a visual scale to make comparisons much simpler.
