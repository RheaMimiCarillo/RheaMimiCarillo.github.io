**1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

|   SQL  |  noSQL |
| ------ | ------ |
|  tables      | graphs, key-value pairs       |
| predefined schema       |   dynamic schema     |
| vertically scaled       | horizontally scaled       |
| professional support readily available       | community-based support       |

**2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

SQL is good for non-hierarchial data.

**3. Give a real world example.**

At my old civil engineering job, we used relational databases running Oracle to store metadata for points we captures during land surveys using gps and optical equipment.

**4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL is good for storing graph databases, key-value pairs, documents, column store databases, and XML databases.

**5. Give a real world example.**

Amazon offers NoSQL databases through AWS.

**6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL is better for hierarchical data storage over SQL.

**7. Which type of database is best for scalability?**

Both are good for scalability under different contexts. SQL databases best for vertically scaling whilst NoSQL is better for horizontal scaling.

Non-tabular databases that can store data using a variety of documents.

**6. How does it work?**

It works by using a JSON database

**7. What is inside of a Mongo database?**

Documents, key-value pairs, wide-column databases, and graph databases

**8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB is more flexible, since we won't be limited to pre-defined schema

**9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
