react button note: variant="Primary": is how bootstrap will make the button look and behave. for example a "primary" button will look blue, by default

for the "sort" part of lab 04, instead of using an "if" I want to see if I can use a "switch"

put the state for the 'favorites' for each beast a level up from where it would render
for example, put an array of beasts in app.js

to update state for an event listener, so that state is updated before a form is submitted:
1. make a new method/event handler that updates state before the submit form


1. make one for when user inputs a value into a form
2. make another to make an api request, after the value is updated in state
